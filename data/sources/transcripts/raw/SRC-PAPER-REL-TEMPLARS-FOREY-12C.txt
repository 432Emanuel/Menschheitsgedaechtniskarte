                       The Emergence of the Military
                       Order in the Twelfth Century
                                                       byA.J. FOREY




             A        t the time when encyclopaedic works on the military orders began
                      to be produced in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it
                      was widely held that the military order was an institution which
             had existed for most of the Christian era. Many of the orders catalogued
             in these volumes were reported to have been founded well before the period
             of the crusades, although there were often conflicting opinions about the
             precise antiquity of a particular foundation. Various dates were, for
             example, given for the establishment of the military order which the
             knights of the Holy Sepulchre were thought to constitute: although some
             held that it had been founded shortly after the first crusade, its creation
             was attributed by others to St James the Less in the first century A.D., while
             its origins were also placed in the time of Constantine and in that of
             Charlemagne. The foundation of the order of Santiago, which in fact
             occurred in n 7 0 , was often traced back to the ninth century; yet while
             some linked it with the supposed discovery of the body of St James during
             the reign of Alfonso 11, others associated it with the legendary victory of
             Clavijo, which was placed in the time of Ramiro i.1 The accumulation of
             myth and tradition recorded in these encyclopaedias has exercised a
             prolonged influence on historians of the military orders: disproof has not
             always been sufficient to silence a persistent tradition. It is, nevertheless,
             clear that the Christian military order, in the sense of an institution whose
             members combined a military with a religious way of life, in fact originated
             during the earlier part of the twelfth century in the Holy Land. The first
             foundation of this kind was the order of the Temple, which was established
             probably in the year 11192 for the purpose of protecting pilgrims visiting

              the holy places and which by 1128 had become involved in the defence
              of the kingdom of Jerusalem and was assisting in wars against the infidel
              in Syria. Whatever traditions and legends may have later developed,
              contemporaries were well aware that it was then that the institution of
              the military order was emerging. St Bernard was clearly in no doubt, for
              he wrote of the Temple: 'novum militiae genus ortum nuper auditur in
              terris.. .novum, inquam, militiae genus, et saeculis inexpertum'. 3 The
              Templar rule itself refers to 'hoc genus novum religionis', and similar-
              phrases are encountered in various other twelfth-century works.4
                 In undertaking the protection of pilgrims and the defence of the Holy
              Land the Templars were responding to an obvious need. Despite the
              establishment of Christian states in Syria after the first crusade, pilgrims
              visiting Jerusalem were still beset by dangers as they travelled through the
              Holy Land. The English pilgrim Saewulf, who undertook a pilgrimage in
              the first decade of the twelfth century, recounts that Muslims lurked by
              day and night in caves in the mountains between Jaffa and Jerusalem,
              ready to ambush Christians journeying to and from the coast.5 The
              experience of the Russian pilgrim Daniel of Kiev was similar, and Walter
              Map tells a story of repeated attacks at a watering place outside Jerusalem
              which are supposed to have occasioned the foundation of the Temple.8 If
              by protecting pilgrims the Templars were supplying an obvious need, they
              were doing the same when they made the transition to fighting with the
              Christian armies in Syria against the infidel. After the capture of Jerusalem
              in 1099 only a few crusaders had stayed in the East: according to Fulcher
              a letter from Ivo of Chartres to Hugh of Champagne (P.L., clxii. 251-3 ep. 245) to take
              the origins of the Temple back several years earlier. Bulst-Thiele is certainly right in
             arguing that Hugh was not joining the Hospital, as was thought by H. Arbois de
             Jubainville, Histoire des dues et des comtes de Champagne, Paris i860, ii. 110-14; DUt ' l m a y
              be doubted whether the letter refers to the Temple either, for Hugh is said to have vowed
            /himself to the militia Christi already before setting out to the East: ' Hierosolymam
             profecturus militiae Christi te ipsum devovisti'; Ivo moreover speaks of the militia as
             fighting with 10,000 against 20,000 and it could therefore hardly refer to the Temple; and
             in speaking of Hugh's separation from his wife he quotes a text (1 Cor. vii. 5) which refers
             to a temporary separation; cf. Ivo, Decretum, viii. 127, 133, in P.L., clxi. 612-13. Hugh
             may in fact have been taking merely a crusading vow, for which a wife's consent was
             apparently necessary: J. A. Brundage, Medieval Canon Law and the Crusader, Madison 1969,

             of Chartres Baldwin i had only three hundred knights in his service at the
             beginning of his reign.7 And amongst those who did remain the mortality
             rate was high. War and disease prevented the emergence of a stable
             knightly class in the early years of the twelfth century.8 At that time bands
             of crusaders did, of course, continue to travel out to the Holy Land and
             were able to provide temporary assistance, but only a few settled
             permanently in the East. The Christian rulers could seek military service
             from the native population, but the latter did not always constitute a
             reliable element;9 and although natives were also at times hired as
             mercenaries, difficulties in paying troops were apparently already being
             experienced in Baldwin I'S reign.10 Yet, if in the early twelfth century
             pilgrims needed protection and the crusader states required military aid,
             it is necessary to explain why a solution to these problems was sought in
             the creation of an institution which combined the use of force with a
             religious way of life.
                 Some historians have discerned the influence of Islamic models. Early
             in the nineteenth century the Austrian orientalist Joseph von Hammer
             stressed the similarities between the Templars and the Assassins; and,
             although much of Hammer's work on that sect has been discredited, a
             more recent writer has again suggested an Assassin influence on the
             Templars.11 But the parallels in organisation and dress to which attention
             has been drawn are based partly on questionable evidence and would in
             any case hardly be close enough to imply borrowing.12 Nor do twelfth-
             century sources suggest that Christian contemporaries regarded the
             Templars and Assassins as very alike: although William of Tyre uses the
             words magister and preceptor - terms employed in the military orders - to
             describe the leader of the Assassins, he refers to the latter as a people
             (populus), not an order.13
                In 1820, two years after the appearance of Hammer's work, the Spanish
             historian Jose Antonio Conde suggested that the origins of the Christian

            military order were to be found in the Islamic institution of the ribat, which
            has been described as a fortified convent whose inmates combined a
            religious way of life with fighting against the enemies of Islam; and this
            view has continued to receive support, especially from certain Spanish
            historians.14 The claim is not based on any direct evidence of borrowing.
            It rests on the supposed similarities between the Islamic and Christian
            institutions, and on the assumption that the combining of a religious and
            military way of life was alien to Christian tradition, which forbade clerics
            to shed blood: St Bernard's delay in writing in support of the Templars
            when repeatedly petitioned by their master Hugh of Payns is taken by
            Castro as providing 'a measure of the great distance that separated the
            new military orders from the Christian conception of life'.15 It might, of
            course, be objected that if the gulf was so wide Christians would not have
            copied the Muslims, but it has been argued that the barrier which had
            to be overcome before Christians could accept the Islamic model was
            negotiated by a process of' stimulus diffusion': the divide was too great
            for the imitation to be consciously acknowledged, but the Islamic concept
            of the ribat acted as a stimulus, which led to its re-invention on the
            Christian side as the military order.18
                The attractiveness of this argument is that its advocates cannot be
             expected to produce evidence in its support. Yet the theory of borrowing
             would be strengthened if it could be shown in the first place that the Franks
             who settled in the Holy Land after the first crusade had knowledge of the
             Islamic institution. Evidence concerning ribats is, however, sparse, and
             investigation is further hampered by the fact that the term ribat was also
             used to describe buildings which were not military strongholds.17 Those
             who maintain that the Islamic institution was the model for the military
             orders have not demonstrated that there were military ribats along the
             Muslim borders with the crusader states at the time of the foundation of
             the Temple; and as interest in holy war was only slowly renewed in this
             area of Islam in the decades following the first crusade it may be doubted
                14

             whether any ribats of this kind were created during the early twelfth
             century in the districts bordering on the Christian states.18
                Even if it were accepted that the Franks in the East knew of the Islamic
             ribat, it may still be questioned whether it could have provided the model
             for the Christian military order. Little information survives about the
             interior life of ribats, but it seems that at least in some instances fortresses
             were defended in part by garrisons of professional soldiers, who were
             merely assisted by volunteers who combined devotional practices with
             fighting.19 These volunteers, who have been seen as the forerunners of the
             Templars, in some cases decided to end their lives giving service of this
             kind, but the majority were individuals who served for only a limited
             period - often for a term of forty days or during Ramadan. 20 Such
             volunteers, serving on a temporary basis, had little in common with the
             members of the Christian military orders. They were merely Muslims who
             led devout lives while fighting, and may be compared more readily with
             the western crusader, who was expected to live soberly and devoutly and
             who in some instances had to serve for a fixed term in order to obtain an
             indulgence. They may also be compared with the secular knights who lived
             and fought with the Templars for a fixed period but did not become
             full members of the order.21 To have imitated the ribat would not therefore
             have produced the military order.
                It has recently been argued, however, that those who served temporarily
             with the Temple provide a link between that order and the Islamic
             institution.22 It appears to be claimed that the Templars' vows of poverty,
             chastity and obedience date only from the time of the Council of Troyes
             in 1128, when the order's rule was drawn up, and that before that time
             those giving temporary service constituted at least a major element. But
             this characterisation of the early Templars is scarcely substantiated.
             Temporary members are certainly mentioned in clauses which may have
             been added to the Templar rule by the patriarch ofJerusalem about the
             year 1130,23 but the only evidence for the period up to 1128 that is adduced
             is the preamble of a charter of donation - attributed to the year
             1125-which speaks of the Templars protecting pilgrims but does not
             mention a religious way of life.24 Yet, as it does not mention temporary

             service either, it is hardly of significance; and the document has in any
             case been assigned to a later date by several commentators.25 It is not
             known, in fact, whether there were any temporary members at all at the
             outset: crusaders coming from the West might have been expected to
             associate themselves more readily with the Temple once it had joined the
             Frankish armies in fighting against the infidel. The evidence which does
             exist concerning the period up to 1128 hardly fits the proposed
             interpretation. A letter written probably in 1125 by St Bernard to Hugh
             of Champagne, who had become a Templar, clearly implies a permanent
             vocation of a monastic type: the abbot of Clairvaux, for example, writes
             of Hugh's becoming 'pauper ex divite', implying that he had abandoned
             all his possessions.26 No very early description survives of the foundation
             of the Temple, but those which were written in the twelfth century all
             assume that a religious form of life was adopted from the outset; and
             Walter Map is the only writer who mentions temporary as well as
             permanent members when discussing the order's early years.27 The rule
             compiled in 1128, which depicts a religious form of life, was, moreover,
             based on existing Templar observances, which Hugh of Payns expounded
             to the assembled prelates at the Council of Troyes.28 Admittedly, it could
             be pointed out that when Fulk of Anjou travelled out to Jerusalem about
             1120, he stayed, according to Orderic Vitalis, with the Templars: 'ibique
             militibus Templi associatus aliquandiu permansit'. 29 Yet this wording
             itself implies that the Templars themselves were in a different category
             from Fulk. The argument seems, in fact, to be based primarily on the
             assumption that the Temple in its early stages was similar to the
             confraternity which was founded at Belchite in Aragon in 1122.30 This did
             include temporary members, and it has been argued that its foundation
             was influenced by the ribat. Certainly there are parallels between the
             confraternity of Belchite and the ribat, 31 but even if it were accepted that
             one was based on the other, it cannot just be taken for granted, without
             reference to evidence, that the Temple in Jerusalem was in the beginning
             similar to an Aragonese institution or that it emerged under similar
             influences.
                 Alternatively, it could be argued that the Franks would not fully have

                                    EMERGENCE OF THE MILITARY ORDER
             understood the nature of the Islamic institution and that - with the
             inevitable tendency to assimilate alien institutions to Christian ones - they
             would have viewed the ribat as a kind of monastery. But there would still
             remain the further objection that the original function of the Temple
             differed from that of the ribat. The latter was a fortress near the borders
             of Islam established for the purpose of warfare against the infidel; the
             Templars, however, adopted their characteristic way of life in the first
             instance merely in order to afford protection to pilgrims, and they had
             their residence in Jerusalem and not in a frontier castle. And the later
             transition to fighting with the Christian armies against Islam, which did
             not involve any fundamental change in the Templars' manner of life, is
             easily explained by the shortage of military personnel in the crusader
             states.
                 If the Temple both in its earliest known form and in its original function
             differed from the ribat, it must be asked whether the emergence of the
             military order can be explained in a purely Christian context. This
             question has not been considered in any detail by those who seek to link
             the military order with the ribat. In adopting a religious way of life the
             Templars and later military orders certainly modelled themselves in some
             respects on existing religious foundations within western Christendom. This
             is immediately apparent from a perusal of the rules of the military orders,
             which closely followed earlier rules and which in some instances borrowed
             directly from them.32 The life lived by members of the orders in their
             convents did not differ essentially from that of other religious in western
             Christendom: only minor amendments to the usual monastic regime were
             made to take account of such matters as the eastern climate and the need
             for brethren to be strong enough to fight.33 But it has to be discovered
             whether the Christian background can explain the fusion of the religious
             life with military activities.
                 As has been seen, some of those who have sought to link the military
             order with the ribat have pointed out that clerics were forbidden to fight;
             and there were obviously numerous canons containing this prohibition,
             even if in practice many clerics - like the priest on the first crusade
             described by Anna Comnena34 - did engage in warfare. But the Templars
             and members of other military orders who fought were not clerics. Only
             their chaplains received the tonsure and were clerici;35 and in all of the
                32
                   Borrowings from the Benedictine rule are indicated in the text of the Templar rule

             ignored.

                   In some orders members were commanded to have their hair trimmed so that their

              military orders the distinction was made between these clerics and the
             fratres laid.36 To the latter, who included all except the chaplains,
              the prohibition on bearing arms did not apply, as was made clear by
              Innocent m in a letter about the Templars which was sent to the king of
              Armenia early in the thirteenth century:
                    cum vim vi repellere omnes leges et omnia jura permittant, ab iis maxime qui vim
                    repellendo irregularitatem non contrahunt, cum clerici non existant, videtur plerisque
                    quod contra te offendentem se possint defendere tibique impugnanti valeant
                    repugnare. 37

                 Yet fighting might also at first sight seem to have been incompatible
              with the religious life, by means of which men sought to express their love
              of God and to devote themselves to his service away from the world and
              remote from secular affairs and concerns. This form of life was characterised
              by a contemptus mundi, and the individual who practised it was expected,
              in the words of the Benedictine rule, 'seculi actibus se facere alienum'. 38
              Certainly in the early Middle Ages the gulf between the military and the
              religious life was seen to be wide. Smaragdus, abbot of Saint-Mihiel,
              commenting in the early ninth century on the phrase 'Domino Christo
              vero regi militaturus' in the prologue of the Benedictine rule, drew a stark
              contrast between monks and warriors:
                    Sunt enim milites saeculi, sunt et milites Christi; sed milites saeculi infirma et lubrica
                    arma, milites autem Christi fortissima sumunt atque praeclara. Pugnant illi contra
                    hostes, ut se et interfectos aeternam perducant ad poenam; pugnant isti contra vitia,
                    ut post mortem aeternam vitam consequi possint ad praemia; illi ut descendant ad
                    tartara, isti ut ascendant ad gloriam; illi ut post mortem cum daemonibus mancipentur
                    in inferno, isti ut cum angelis in perpetuo possideant regnum; illi ut daemoniis
                    socientur semper, isti ut cum angelis semper laetentur; illi ut cum diabolo semper
                    lugeant, isti cum Christo exsultent.3*

              Two centuries later Adalbero, bishop of Laon, again pointed the contrast,
              for it was to satirise the activities of Cluny that he called the abbot Odilo
              militiae princeps and referred to the Cluniacs as 'monachorum bellicus

              to admit clerics to the Temple was confirmed by Innocent n in 1139: R. Hiestand

              F. H. Russell, The Just War in the Middle Ages, Cambridge 1975, 251, asserts that Robert
              of Flamborough considered the members of military orders to be clerics, but tacitly
              exempted them from the prohibition on fighting; in fact he calls them merely personas
              religiosas: Liber poenitentialis, cap. 148, ed. J. J. F. Firth, Toronto 1971, 150.

                     P.L., ccxvi. 54-6. That Innocent does not employ a more comprehensive term than
              plerisque is probably to be explained by the fact that the question at issue was the use of
              force against Christians.

                                    EMERGENCE OF THE MILITARY ORDER
                       40
              ordo'. In some ways the gulf would appear to have been widening in
              the eleventh century, for - partly as a reaction to current trends within
              the Church - there was a desire to demarcate more precisely the various
              elements in society. This is apparent in Adalbero's Carmen ad Rotbertum
              regem and in the writings of others such as John of Fecamp, who
              complained that 'clerus et populus, sacerdos et monachus nil in actibus
              nil in moribus differunt', and who argued that 'conturbat.. .totum
              corporis ordinem qui non suo contentus officio subripit alienum'. 41 One
              consequence of this attitude was a new emphasis amongst religious on
              complete withdrawal from the world. Yet while this further retreat
              represented one trend in the religious life of the eleventh and early twelfth
              centuries, there was also a development of institutions, involving both
              clerics and laymen, which sought to adapt this form of life to more active
              pursuits, such as charitable work and preaching, as is apparent from the
              establishment of hospices and hospitals as well as from the foundation of
              houses of regular canons. To some, an active life of this kind seemed
              superior to a purely contemplative existence.*2 Yet these forms of active
              life might appear to be far removed from the sordid business of fighting.
              But in seeking to explain the emergence of the military orders it is necessary
              to take account of the efforts which had been made by the early twelfth
              century to transform the warrior class and also of the new evaluation which
              had been placed on some forms of warfare.43
                  Partly in response to a disorderly political situation in parts of the West,
              there had been an attempt to christianise knighthood: militia came to be
              contrasted with malitia,** and the term miles Christi, formerly applied
              mainly to monks, came to acquire a new meaning. It was stressed that
              it was the function of the warrior to protect and defend the poor and weak,
              the Church and Christianity, and not to plunder and pillage. An early
              formulation of this concept was provided by Odo of Cluny, who wrote in
              his Vita sancti Geraldi Auriliacensis comitis
                     licuit igitur laico homini in ordine pugnatorum posito gladium portare, ut inerme
                     vulgus velut innocuum pecus a lupis, ut scriptum est, vespertinis defensaret.46

              A fuller definition of knightly duties was given in the later eleventh century
              by the Gregorian theorist Bonizo of Sutri:
                      His proprium est dominis deferre, prede non iniare, pro vita dominorum suorum
                      tuenda sue vite non parcere et pro statu rei publice usque ad mortem decertare,
                      scismaticos et hereticos debellare, pauperes quoque et viduas et orphanos defensare,
                      fidem promissam non violare nee omnino dominis suis periurare. 46

             A similar concept, though with a different emphasis, is also revealed by
             John of Salisbury, who in the mid-twelfth century defined the obligations
             of a true knight as:
                      tueri ecclesiam, perfidiam impugnare, sacerdotium uenerari, pauperum propulsare
                      iniurias, pacare prouinciam, pro fratribus.. .fundere sanguinem et, si opus est,
                      animam ponere.47
                The emergence of the military orders is obviously to be related to the
              development of the concept of true knighthood, which they were seen to
              exemplify. St Bernard described both the Templars and crusaders as
              belonging to the true militia, which he contrasted with the old malitia, and
              in the De laude novae militiae he distinguished at length between the
              Templars and the militia saecularis, which fought for worldly glory and
              gain.48 In the prologue of the Templar rule it was said of the order that:
                      in ipsa namque refloruit jam et revixit ordo militaris, qui despecto justicie zelo non
                      pauperes aut aecclesias defensare, quod suum erat, sed rapere, spoliare, interficere
                      contendebant; 49

              and the prologue of the rule of Santiago similarly saw the founders of that
              order ceasing to be the equiles diaboli which they had been until then.50 The
              link between the military orders and the new concept of knighthood is
              made further apparent by examining contemporary descriptions of the
              orders' activities, for these provide many parallels with the various
              definitions of true knighthood and with accounts of the functions of others,
              such as crusaders, who were held to belong to the true militia. The military
              orders' role was commonly regarded as a defensive one. This was
              occasionally expressed in terms of protecting land: a charter issued by the
                 44

              Gregory VII'S pontificate in this context has been discussed by I. S. Robinson, 'Gregory
              vn and the soldiers of Christ', History, lviii (1973), 169-92. Before the end of the eleventh
              century the practice had begun of blessing a knight's sword 'quatinus defensio atque
              protectio possit esse aecclesiarum, viduarum, orphanorum omniumque Deo servientium

                                    EMERGENCE OF THE MILITARY ORDER
             Castilian King Alfonso vm in 1185, for example, speaks of the brethren
             of Santiago fighting for the patria and defending ' Christianitatis loca et
             habitationes', while Templar recruits had to promise to guard the lands
             which the Christians held in the East.51 Yet, although to the historian the
             struggle with the infidel may seem to have been primarily about land,
             Christian accounts of Turkish conquests before the first crusade indicate
             that it became widely held in the West that in the conquered territories
             churches were defiled, Christians slaughtered and the faith brought to
             nothing.52 It is not, therefore, surprising that the military orders were
             usually regarded as protecting and defending the Church, the Christian
             religion and the faithful: the statement in the prologue of the Templar
             rule that the order had been established ' ad defensionem sancte aecclesiae'
             has many parallels in papal bulls and royal and princely charters.53 The
             terminology of defence became so much the norm that it was still used
             even when it was scarcely appropriate. In a charter which in 1175 assigned
             a fifth of Castilian conquests to the order of Calatrava the function of that
             order was still described merely as providing a wall and shield for the
             defence of the Christian faith.54 But the orders' role was not always
             described in purely defensive terms. Like crusaders, they were also seen
             to be fighting a war of vengeance and expansion. St Bernard wrote of the
             Templar knight as 'Christi vindex in his qui male agunt', and a papal
             bull speaks of the members of that order as fighting' pro ulciscendis iniuriis
             Ihesu Christi'. 55 And just as in 1095 crusaders were recruited 'ad
             liberandam ecclesiam Dei', so Innocent 11 applied this phrase to the
             Templars and exhorted them to fight not only for the defence of the church
             but also' p r o . . . ea, que est sub paganorum tyrannide, de ipsorum spurcitia
             eruenda'. 58 In 1143 the count of Barcelona granted extensive properties
             to the Templars not merely for the defence of the Church but also 'ad
             deprimendam et debellandam et expellendam gentem maurorum', while
             on other occasions reference was made to extending and propagating the
             Christian faith.57 But offensive activity of this kind was to further the

             interests of the Church and Christianity, and in the context of the twelfth
             century referred to the recovery of territories which were thought rightly
             to belong to Christendom and the freeing of the Church and the faithful
             from oppression.58
                Although in fulfilling these functions the military orders appear at times
             to have been encouraged to slaughter the infidel,59 their members were
             more often depicted as exposing themselves to injury and death: their own
             readiness to die was stressed rather than their killing of the enemy. In the
             bull Omne datum optimum issued by Innocent n in 1139 and in many other
             papal letters it was said of the Templars that they did not fear to lay down
             their own lives,60 while on other occasions the dangers which brethren of
             the orders risked were emphasised.61 The Templar rule states that it is a
             duty 'pro fratribus animam ponere', just as it is for John of Salisbury's
             knight,62 and some Spanish documents of the later twelfth century
             represent members of the military orders as vowing to shed their blood
             and die: 'voverunt sponte contra crucis Christi adversarios et proprium
             sanguinem fundere et temporalem vitam finire'.63 The rule of Santiago
             similarly makes reference to choosing to die.64 Of course, deliberately to
             seek death in the way that some missionaries in Islamic lands did or as
             the bishop of Soissons did on Louis ix's Egyptian crusade was scarcely
             desirable from a military standpoint, and it was not in fact the primary
             objective of most of those belonging to the military orders. Although there
             were inevitably moments of rashness on campaign, the orders - as is clear
             from Templar regulations governing conduct in the field65 - sought to
             provide a disciplined and effective force. Aquinas was therefore more
             realistic when he wrote that the military orders 'directius ordinantur ad
             hoc quod effundant sanguinem hostium quam ad hoc quod eorum sanguis
             fundatur'. 66 But this view was not the one most commonly expressed.
                Yet, while the military orders by the nature of their activities were seen
             to form part of the true militia, they differed from crusaders and others
             by combining these functions with a religious form of life. This was possible
             because a new evaluation had been placed on fighting. By the early twelfth
                se
                   The subject of conversion is mentioned only very rarely in documents concerning the
             military orders: Martin, Origenes, 248-54, doc. 73; Gallego Blanco, Rule of St James, 110,
             cap. 30.
                " Although in chapter three of the De laude novae militiae St Bernard argued that infidels
             should not be killed if they could be prevented in other ways from oppressing the faithful,
             he had earlier appeared to encourage the Templars to seek to kill when he wrote of the
             miles Christi that 'cum occidit malefactorem, non homicida, sed, ut ita dixerim, malicida
             .. .Mors ergo quam irrogat, Christi est lucrum.. .In morte pagani christianus gloriatur,

                                    EMERGENCE OF THE MILITARY ORDER
             century some kinds of warfare and even some killing were no longer
             considered to be sinful; joining the true militia had on the contrary become
             widely accepted as a new way of achieving salvation. The origins of the
             latter idea can be traced back at least to the ninth century, and it finds
             frequent expression in the sources for the first crusade, where those
             participating in the expedition are promised remission of sins and those
             dying on the crusade are regarded as martyrs. This development hardly
             requires illustration;67 but it should be pointed out that in the true militia
             fighting was no longer devoted to the worldly ends of personal glory and
             material gain; it ceased to be regarded as a purely secular activity and
             by the beginning of the twelfth century had become commonly accepted
             as a work of charity and a way of expressing love of God and of one's
             neighbours and brothers. Urban n wrote to the Bolognese in 1096 that
             the crusaders ' res et personas suas pro Dei et proximi charitate exposue-
             runt', while, in Baldric of Dol's version of the pope's speech at Clermont,
             Urban states that 'caritas est pro fratribus animas ponere'. 98 When
             Innocent n in 1139 wrote of the Templars as 'vere karitatis flamma
             succensi', and asserted that by their deeds they fulfilled the words of the
             Gospel, 'maiorem hac dilectionem nemo habet, quam ut animam suam
             ponat quis pro amicis suis', he was not expressing a new concept.69 To
             fight in the true militia was therefore to abandon worldly concerns and
             material desires. Like monks, those who went on crusade were devoting
             themselves to the service of God, while the activities of the true knighthood
             were also comparable with the charitable work undertaken by various
             religious institutions on behalf of the poor, the sick and pilgrims!70
                Despite the apparent contrast between the life of the monk and that of
             the warrior, the wide gulf which had earlier separated the religious from
             the military way of life no longer existed. Guibert of Nogent, in a frequently
             quoted comment, viewed the monastic life and participation in a crusade
             as alternative routes to salvation:
                   Instituit nostro tempore praelia sancta Deus, ut ordo equestris et vulgus oberrans, qui
                   vetustae paganitatis exemplo in mutuas versabantur caedes, novum repperirent

             sought salvation, and the miles seculi, who would be damned, and used some
             of the same texts to illustrate their arguments, for St Bernard in his De
             laude novae militiae the miles Christi was a warrior and not the monk of the
             earlier work. It was in fact the bridging of the gulf between the two that
             enabled the term miles Christi to be applied to the warrior. The way was
             therefore open for the two kinds ofmiles Christi to be combined in the same
             person and for an institution to emerge' qua gemino pariter conflictu atque
             infatigabiliter decertatur, turn adversus carnem et sanguinem, turn contra
             spiritualia nequitiae in caelestibus'.73
                The Temple was the first institution founded for the purpose of
             participating in this double conflict: at the outset the members of that
             order were merely extending the range of charitable activities undertaken
             by religious institutions on behalf of pilgrims, but they were soon also
             combining a religious way of life with fighting alongside other Christian
             forces in the East against Islam. Yet they were not the first religious to
             take up arms; and monks who had earlier engaged in fighting had found
             defenders long before the foundation of the Temple. In the early eleventh
             century Bernard of Angers had written approvingly of a prior of Conques
             who had been accustomed to wage war on malefactors. Bernard argued
             that 'plus hoc ad virtutem quam ad impugnationem monastice regule
             poterit referre', and even went on to add:
                      utinam monachus desidiosus, deposita ignavia, ad utilitatem sui monasterii sic fortiter
                      ageret, potius quam sui ordinis habitum honestum preferens extrinsecus, iniquitatis
                      latibulum faceret intrinsecus.74
              The Cluniac chronicler Raoul Glaber was not so outspoken when he
              reported that monks in Spain had fought against al-Mansur. But he stated

              of a military and religious way of life was at variance with accepted norms in the West

              and his followers to adopt a new way of life. But he does not explain why men who had
              recently come from the West should have formed a religious community for this purpose,
              if it was out of keeping with western views.

             that 'potius ob fraterne caritatis amorem cupierant decertare, quam
             propter aliquam gloriam laudis ponpatice', and said that a vision had
             revealed that those who had died had gained salvation.75 Although on this
             occasion monks had taken up arms only out of necessity, Raoul's comment
             provides a clear anticipation of twelfth-century attitudes towards com-
             bining a religious form of life with fighting.
                In the century before the foundation of the Temple the emergence of
             the military order had also been foreshadowed, though in a less significant
             way, by the creation - in areas away from the borders of Christendom and
             among those who would have had no knowledge of Islam - of secular
             confraternities devoted to the proper purposes of knighthood. Some sprang
             from attempts to enforce peace decrees. In some instances an obligation
             was placed on the whole population to use force if necessary to maintain
             the peace, but smaller associations were also founded, either at the
             instigation of bishops or on the initiative of groups of nobles. Wazo of Liege
             is reported to have exacted an oath from a small band of knights who
             undertook to support him and his church, 76 and towards the end of the
             eleventh century a military confraternity often nobles was established for
             the protection of the monastery of La Sauve near Bordeaux: their swords
             were consecrated in the monastery church and they promised to defend
             the monks and the monastery's property and also to protect pilgrims
             visiting the house.77 Military associations were also formed among those
             going on the first crusade. Raymond of Aguilers mentions a confraternity
             established at the siege of Antioch: it had a common treasury, which was
             to provide money for the replacement of horses.78 The importance of these
             confraternities should obviously not be exaggerated. They appear all to
             have been loose associations with little formal organisation; and they were
             all secular groupings. Yet they should not be completely ignored in a
             discussion of the emergence of the military order.
                If the appearance of the military order can thus be related to recent
             developments within western Christendom, it does not mean that the new
             institution failed to arouse doubts and opposition. It would be more
             surprising if opinion had been uniformly favourable, for the changes which
             had been taking place in the West had not gained universal acceptance.
             Critics could quote many authorities which seemed to conflict with the
             new attitudes to warfare, and the theoretical basis for the latter had still
             not been fully elaborated. But some evidence which might seem to imply
             uncertainty or hostility can be interpreted more satisfactorily in other

            ways. It is certainly true that in their early years the Templars gained little
            support, and this could be taken as an indication of doubts and opposition.
            William of Tyre's remark that after nine years there were still only nine
            members can be taken as merely a play on numbers, but the chronicler
            was implying that during that early period there was no marked increase
            in membership.79 There is similarly little record of patronage of the
            Templars in the West before the later 1120s. But this absence of support
            is to be attributed to a lack of awareness rather than to disapproval.80
            When Hugh of Payns and several of his colleagues did travel to the West,
            probably in 1127, the order quickly began to receive gifts in various parts
            of western Europe, 81 and ecclesiastical approval was gained at the
            beginning of 1128 at the Council of Troyes, which was presided over by
            the papal legate, Matthew of Albano, and attended by the archbishops
            of Reims and Sens and their bishops and also by a number of abbots,
            including those of Citeaux and apparently of Clairvaux.82 The Templars
            were quickly regarded with favour by ecclesiastics drawn from all parts
            of the Church, including the new monastic orders,83 as well as achieving
            rapid popularity in the lay world.
               It is true, as Castro has indicated, that it was only after Hugh of Payns
            had made three requests that St Bernard wrote the De laude novae militiae.
            His own explanation for the delay was that he was unfitted for the task:
                     Distuli sane aliquamdiu, non quod contemnenda videretur petitio, sed ne levis
                     praecepsque culparetur assensio, si quod melius melior implere sufficeret, praesumerem
                     imperitus, et res admodum necessaria per me minus forte commoda redderetur.84

             Such expressions of modesty were not uncommon among writers,85 and this
             explanation does not necessarily reveal the true motives for St Bernard's
             delay, but Castro's suggestion is by no means the only possible or probable
             alternative. The letter which the abbot of Clairvaux wrote to Hugh of
             Champagne when the latter joined the Templars has, however, also been
             seen as an indication of St Bernard's uncertainty about the Templars' way

                   Of the two recorded acquisitions which can be assigned to the earlier 1120s, one was
             from Fulk of Anjou, who had recently been out to the East, and the other was of property
             near Marseille, an obvious point of contact between East and West: Ordericus Vitalis,

             earlier 1120s.

             of life. But in that letter St Bernard is not obviously doing anything more
             than mourn the absence of a friend:
                   Ceterum, quod tua iucunda praesentia nobis ita nescio quo Dei est subtracta iudicio,
                   ut ne interdum quidem videre te valeamus, sine quo numquam, si fieri posset, esse
                   vellemus, hoc aequanimiter, fateor, non portamus. 8 '

                Yet both St Bernard's De laude novae militiae and a letter written at about
             the same time to the Templars by a certain Hugh - it has been attributed
             to both Hugh of Payns and Hugh of St Victor87 - reveal that there were
             some misgivings and difficulties. The repetition of Hugh of Payns's request
             to the abbot of Clairvaux could be explained at least in part by the
             Temple's failure to become widely known before the later 1120s; but,
             although St Bernard's reply is a sermo exhortationis rather than a cool
             analysis of objections such as Aquinas later attempted, it is an answer to
             criticisms which were being made of the Templars, while Hugh's letter
             shows that some members of the order were themselves experiencing
             doubts as well as being criticised by outsiders. But the grounds for
             the doubts and hostility require definition.
                In the first chapter of the De laude novae militiae St Bernard comments:
                   Et quidem ubi solis viribus corporis corporeo former hosti resistitur, id quidem ego
                   tarn non iudico mirum, quam nee rarum existimo. Sed et quando animi virtute vitiis
                   sive daemoniis bellum indicitur, ne hoc quidem mirabile etsi laudabile dixerim, cum
                   plenus monachis cernatur mundus. Ceterum cum uterque homo suo quisque gladio
                   potenter accingitur, suo cingulo nobiliter insignitur, quis hoc non aestimet omni
                   admiratione dignissimum,. quod adeo liquet esse insolitum.88

             The wording of this extract, and particularly of the last clause, implies that
             one ground for criticism was merely the common suspicion in this period
             of any innovation: when the past provided authority, anything new was
             suspect, whatever its character. That this was one element in the criticism
             of the Templars is also suggested by the fact that later in the treatise St
             Bernard adopts the tactics frequently employed by those seeking to
             counter accusations of novelty: he attempts to root the order of the Temple
             firmly in the past. He cannot pretend that it is an ancient foundation,89
             but he quotes several biblical prophecies concerning Jerusalem to demon-
             strate 'quam crebra veterum attestatione nova approbatur militia'.90 In

            incurring criticism of this kind the Templars did not, of course, stand alone
            in the early twelfth century. All new orders were attacked for this reason.
            As Anselm of Havelberg reported, many were asking:
                    Quare tot novitates in Ecclesia Dei fiunt? Quare tot ordines in ea surgunt?... Quis
                    denique non scandalizetur, et inter tot et tam diversas formas religionum invicem
                    discrepantium taedioso non afficiatur scandalo? 91

                But some criticism was concerned more specifically with the manner of
            life adopted by the military orders. Although these orders formed part of
            the true militia, in practice the habits of the old malitia were not easily
            overcome. In his letter to the Templars Hugh wrote that the devil sought
            to corrupt good works: 'ille autem qui semper temptat invisibilis
            hostis.. .suggerit odium et furorem dum occiditis, suggerit cupiditatem
            dum spoliatis'.9Z Hugh did not consider that the Templars had succumbed
            to this temptation, because in his view they hated not the man but iniquity,
            and the infidels on account of their sins deserved to lose what was taken
            from them, while the Templars merited reward for their labours. Others,
            however, were not so convinced, and thought it necessary to remind
            brethren of the military orders, as well as crusaders,93 that they should not
            fight for worldly glory or gain. When Alexander m issued a bull of
            confirmation for the order of Santiago in 1175 he decreed that in the
            annual chapter it should be stressed to the brethren that they ought to
            fight' non mundane laudis amore, non desiderio sanguinis effundendi, non
            terrenarum rerum cupiditate'. 94 Similar admonitions were included in the
            rule of that order, and it was there further emphasised that any booty
            gained in war should be devoted to the ransoming of captives.95 In the
            early thirteenth century a further warning was issued by James of Vitry,
            who in a sermon to the military orders maintained that war should not
            be waged out of greed and that brethren should be wary 'ne gloriam suam
            in Christi militia quaerant, vel laudibus hominum acquiescant'. 94
              According to Hugh, the devil was also tempting the Templars to
            abandon their way of life in order to achieve spiritual progress, and he
            explained that he had heard that:
                    quosdam vestrum a quibusdam minus discretis perturbari quasi professio vestra qua
                    vitam vestram ad portanda arma contra inimicos fidei et pacis pro defensione

                                    EMERGENCE OF THE MILITARY ORDER
                     christianorum dedicastis, quasi, inquam, ilia professio vel inlicita sit vel pernitiosa,
                     id est vel peccatum vel majoris profectionis impedimentum. 97

             Hugh is here referring to two criticisms, the second of which regards the
             military order as inferior to some other religious institutions, although not
             to be completely rejected: it is merely a hindrance to greater progress. This
             is restated later in the letter when Hugh says that the devil 'concedit
             bonum esse quod negare non potest, sed suadet pro majori bono minus
             bonum relinquendum esse', and he further explains the objection by
             adding: 'sed forte dicitur quia occupatio que vos per exteriora distrait
             interni profectus et ascensionum spiritualium impedimentum adducit'. 98
             Certainly some outsiders, including St Bernard himself," regarded this
             form of life as inferior to that of the monk, and corroboration of Hugh's
             assertion that the Templars themselves experienced doubts is possibly
             provided by Anselm of Havelberg, who states that when the pope - wrongly
             identified as Urban - gave his approval to the Templars, he affirmed that
             their way of life was of no less merit than that of monks or canons living
             a common life.100 Doubts of this kind could also explain why Innocent n
             in the bull Omne datum optimum placed so much emphasis on the Templars'
             obligation not to leave their order.101 This objection to the military order
             can obviously be related to the constantly revived debate about the
             relative merits of various forms of religious life, although the protagonists
             were usually asserting the superiority of their own way of life rather than
             questioning its value.
                The other criticism mentioned by Hugh was more fundamental, for this
             regarded the Templars' way of life as inlicita and sinful: to devote oneself
             in this way to fighting against the enemies of the faith was wrong. The
             whole concept of the military order appears to be called into question. This
             criticism is not, however, discussed in detail by Hugh. Clarification of the
             issue is to be sought rather in St Bernard's De laude novae militiae. He
             devoted a considerable amount of space to reassuring the Templars that
             to fight and kill the infidel for the sake of Christ and Christianity was not
             only permissible but also meritorious. The third chapter of the treatise thus
             begins:
                     At vero Christi milites securi praeliantur praelia Domini sui, nequaquam metuentes
                     aut de hostium caede peccatum, aut de sua nece periculum, quandoquidem mors pro
                     Christo vel ferenda, vel inferenda, et nihil habeat criminis, et plurimum gloriae
                     mereatur.102

            To St Bernard this seems to have been the main issue of contention: once
            it had been established that fighting could be meritorious, he apparently

            saw no substantial objection to combining a religious with a military way
            of life. Much of St Bernard's argument could therefore equally have been
            applied to crusaders, and parallels can in fact be drawn between the De
            laude novae militiae and St Bernard's later crusading encyclical, Sermo mihi
            ad vos.103 That the evaluation placed on fighting was the central issue in
            discussions concerning the validity of the military orders is also apparent
            from later writings. In a sermon addressed to brethren of the military
            orders James of Vitry claimed that it was being asserted by some that:
                   vobis non licet pro quacumque causa gladium materialem accipere, nee contra hostes
                   Ecclesiae corporaliter pugnare, abutentes auctoritatibus Scripturarum et frivolas
                   rationes inducentes:

             the texts from the New Testament which he listed as being used for this
             purpose were those which appeared to condemn the use of force, such as
             Romans xii. 19 and Matthew xxvi.52.104 Similarly, when Aquinas discussed
             whether a religious institution could be established for military service, the
             main objections which he examined were those which maintained that
             warfare was sinful and a secular matter. In this context reference was made
             to the Sermon on the Mount and to the decree which forbade religiosi to
             act as advocates in lawsuits.105 Aquinas, in response, quoted other texts
             to show that the use of force was lawful, provided that it was ' non quidem
             propter aliquid mundanum, sed propter defensionem divini cultus et
             publicae salutis, vel etiam pauperum et oppressorum'; it was imperfection,
             or even a sin, to tolerate injuries done to another. He also pointed out that
             the office of advocate was forbidden to religious only if it were undertaken
             for worldly motives; the religious life was, therefore, incompatible with
             fighting only if warfare was a secular undertaking. 106 That discussion
             should have centred on this issue is hardly surprising, for it was obviously
             a subject about which the scriptures and other authorities not only had
             much to say but also contained many conflicting statements. On the other
             hand, once it had been accepted that fighting could be a charitable
             activity and that the religious life did not have to be a purely contemplative
             existence, it was difficult to advance cogent arguments against establishing
             religious institutions for laymen engaging in military activities.
                Since the new attitudes to warfare did not gain universal support, the
             military orders continued to be subjected to criticism of an ideological
             nature; and to this was added an increasing amount of hostile comment
             arising from more practical concerns. The new attitudes had, however,
             gained widespread acceptance in the West by the early twelfth century,

                 106
                     Aquinas also considered the argument that fighting is incompatible with the religious
             life because the latter is a state of penance, and righting is forbidden to penitents. He
             pointed out that warfare in the service of God was sometimes imposed as a penance.

                                   EMERGENCE OF THE MILITARY ORDER
            and the military orders can be seen as a product of them. There is no need
            to seek an Islamic model for the military order, and to have copied the
            ribat would in any case not have produced the fusion of the military and
            religious life that characterised the Christian orders. In fact, no Islamic
            influence on the Temple can be perceived at all without making un-
            grounded assumptions, and even then there would still be the obstacle that
            the Temple differed in its original function from the ribat. It is far easier
            to relate the military order to early twelfth-century Christian society in the
            West.
